People, for whatever reason, are "wowed" and "impressed" by my setup. I am not entirely sure why. 

### Configuration 

I used to be the type to take pride in their editor, shell configuration and maintained my own oh-my-zsh lite and spacemacs lite, even. 

But over time, I've become more and more averse to maintaining my own full configuration. That's where these configuration kits come in.

**emacs** [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org)

**zsh** [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

**vim** [spf13](http://vim.spf13.com/)

### Fonts

You may be asking something like:

> But AJ, what's the difference? Aren't writing code and writing prose one and the same?

Certain fonts for me are 

**code** M+ 1m
**writing** Office Code Pro 

### Utilities 

**terminal emulator** iTerm 2 Beta

**color picker** [Color Picker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-picker/id641027709?l=en&mt=12) by [NSCoding](http://nscoding.co.uk/)

### Color Schemes

**iTerm 2** *Glacier*, part of [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).

**Emacs** In spacemacs, you can toggle your color scheme and switch fairly easily between things. So I have 3 different themes enabled.

 - **code** *twilight-anti-bright* For my inner Elliot Alderson, I like things dark and gloomy and crap.
 - **org-mode** *leuven* This is made specifically to make org-mode buffers look extra fancy. I love it.
 - **markdown-mode** *tao-yang*. This looks the most like *iA Writer*, and used in conjunction with *writeroom-mode*, you pretty much have a nice markdown editor within Emacs.
