## The Nerd Responsible

I'm AJ, a software developer currently trying to figure out where my Life is going, exactly. Day by day, I'm also learning to [let it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU).

Currently, I'm a *research programming intern* at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The actual title is "SPIN Intern", but that elicits far too many questions. (e.g. "..so you do spin classes or what?", "What's SPIN lol?").

In my past iteration as a professional, I was an early employee and *software engineer* at [eSpark Learning](http://esparklearning.com). I took 3+ years off from university to work at this ed tech startup (irony, amirite?), and went back to school in Fall 2014.

As for "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" type of questions, secretly, I still want to be [Ellie Arroway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel)) when I grow up. (Which is a way of saying I'm *still* hoping to become an astronaut even though I lack both the athletic and intellectual aptitude for such pursuits).

The programming languages I work with include `Python`, `C/C++`, `Objective-C`,  `Haskell`, `Clojure`, `Ruby`, and `Javascript`. I have the most professional (i.e. paid) experience with `Python`, `Ruby`, `Javascript`, and `Objective-C`. [**NOTE** I managed to weasel my way out of a Java-based Introduction to Computer Science class by way of proficiency exam and self-study, which is why I exclude Java from this list. That's right, nerds, I'm smart..or just weirdly averse to Java to the point where I have managed to avoid it thus far in my career].

When I'm not writing code from the "comfort" of my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) setup, I can sometimes be found writing prose. Since I use [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as my text editor of choice, and since both writing code and prose involves a text editor, this means I spend approximately 95% of my time in Emacs.

Occasionally, I can also be found tinkering with hardware like the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) microcontrollers, [Google Cardboard](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/), [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com), and whatever electronics I get my hands on, basically.

## This Site

Mainly, my goal here is to keep a repository of the things I hack around with, which at the moment seems to primarily involve wrestling with Linux OSes.
